## Spotify-artists-search-tool

As a music enthusiast, I've created a Spotify artist search tool driven by a fun competition with a friend. The goal? To find hidden musical gems among lesser-known artists, especially those with fewer followers. This tool provides a unique way to discover exceptional talent that often goes unnoticed due to Spotify's algorithm.

Using the Spotify API, my tool collects artist data by genre. What makes it special is its ability to set a popularity threshold. You get to decide how well-known or obscure the artists should be. I recommend exploring less popular artists for unique musical finds.

The tool neatly organizes this artist data in a CSV file, sorted by popularity. It's a simple way to explore and expand your music horizons while supporting talented artists who may not yet have widespread recognition. ðŸ˜Š
