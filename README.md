## Spotify-artists-search-tool

As a passionate music enthusiast, I've developed a Spotify artist search tool inspired by a friendly competition with a fellow music lover. My objective is to uncover hidden musical treasures among lesser-known artists, with an emphasis on those who have fewer followers. This tool offers a unique avenue for discovering exceptional talent that often goes unnoticed due to the limitations of Spotify's algorithm.

Utilizing the Spotify API, my search tool collects artist data by extracting information based on specific genres. What sets it apart is the option to set a popularity threshold, enabling users to determine how well-known or obscure they want their selected artists to be. I highly recommend exploring artists with minimal popularity, as this is where you're likely to make some remarkable musical discoveries.

The tool efficiently compiles this artist data into a CSV file, ranking them based on their level of popularity. This approach allows you to easily navigate and explore these artists, ultimately expanding your musical horizons and supporting talented individuals who may not yet have garnered widespread recognition.  :)
